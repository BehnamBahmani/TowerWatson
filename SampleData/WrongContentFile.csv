This example file contains two triangles – one for a product called ‘Comp’ and one for a product called
‘Non-Comp’. The first row contains column headings, and the subsequent rows contain the data, so, for example, for accidents occurring on the Non-Comp product in 1990, 45.2 was paid in 1990, 64.8 was paid in
1991 and 37 was paid in 1993.
